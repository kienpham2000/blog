### Options Basic
Let's say you own 100 shares of TSLA and you don't really care if it goes up or down, you like to hold it long term, basically you are bullish in the long run (few years+). One approach you can do to hedge against risk being bearish in the short run (weeks / month).

You can sell 1 Covered Call since 1 option is worth 100 shares.

### Selling Covered Call (CC)

### Buying Cash Secured Put (CSP)
